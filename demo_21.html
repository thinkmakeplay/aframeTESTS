      Do you want to ... 
      <ul>
        <li><a href="demo_21_2.html">ride the train</a> with music?</li>
        <li>or <a href="demo_21_1.html">watch trains</a> from the centre?</li>
    </ul>
      In either case, the 360 video has an unsightly seam in it - haven't resolved this, as it seems to be the Unity 360 camera causing the problem.  The equirects don't create a seamless texture ?? because the directional light isn't smooth...

      You can limit whether users can turn heads if you have this issue (look-controls), and just take them on a ride. You can make the panoramic video 180 instead of 360.

      Notice that the audio starts immediately (it's part of the video), and despite setting <i>autoplay="false"</i> it continues to play!  At least it doesn't loop all the time now.
